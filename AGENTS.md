# Project Tracker & Agent Instructions

## Role & Workflow
You are an AI assistant maintaining the "Scholar's Dungeon" project. 
At the start of every interaction, you automatically read this file (injected into your system prompt).

**CRITICAL RULE FOR EVERY UPDATE:**
We now separate updates into **Preview Updates** (预览更新) and **Official Updates** (正式更新):

**1. Preview Updates (预览更新 - Default):**
- Update the `APP_VERSION` in `src/version.ts`.
- Update the `Current Version` and `Last Update Date` in this `AGENTS.md` file.
- Log the completed task in the `Task History` section below.
- *Do not* modify `RELEASE_HISTORY` in `src/version.ts` or `public/version.json`.

**2. Official Updates (正式更新 - Only when requested):**
- Do all the steps for Preview Updates.
- Aggregate all features/fixes logged in `AGENTS.md` since the last Official Update.
- Write a comprehensive changelog summarizing these updates.
- Update `RELEASE_HISTORY` in `src/version.ts` with this aggregated changelog.
- Update `public/version.json` with the new version and changelog to trigger the app update popup.

**VERSIONING POLICY (x.y.z):**
- **x (Major):** Critical architectural changes or full-scale system overhauls.
- **y (Minor):** New features, significant UI additions, or functional enhancements.
- **z (Patch):** Bug fixes, micro-optimizations, documentation updates, and UI refinements.

**COMMUNICATION RULE:**
- You MUST ALWAYS reply to the user in Chinese (Simplified). This is an absolute requirement for every response you give.

**CSS & UI STANDARDS:**
- **Full-Screen Modals:** Whenever creating a "full-screen" centered modal (especially `fixed inset-0`), you MUST use `createPortal(..., document.body)` from `react-dom` to render the modal directly on the `body`. If you do not use `createPortal`, parent elements with CSS `transform`, `filter`, or `perspective` will establish unintended containing blocks that capture the `fixed` positioning, causing the modal to appear in the middle of a scrolling page container instead of the actual screen view. Never make this mistake again.
- **Italic Clipping:** To prevent right-side clipping of italic text (especially in browsers with tight bounding boxes), always add a small right padding (e.g., `pr-1` or `px-0.5`) to the element or its immediate container.
- **Red Dot / Notification Placement:** Unread message or notification badges (red dots) on icons and buttons MUST ALWAYS be placed in the bottom-right corner (e.g. `absolute -bottom-0.5 -right-0.5`), NEVER in the top-right corner.
- **Touch-Friendly Controls:** Delete buttons or other critical actions MUST NOT be hover-only (e.g. `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`), as this is unfriendly to touch-screen users. They should be visible or adapt properly for mobile devices.
- **Theme-Aware Colors & Minimalist UI:** We have 6 different theme colors. Every color choice (especially backgrounds, progress bars, or buttons) MUST consider all themes to maintain a minimalist and premium aesthetic. Avoid thick, flashy, or hardcoded colors like `bg-emerald-500` which may look jarring or "rough" (粗率) in certain themes. Rely on theme-aware colors (`indigo-300`, `indigo-400`, `indigo-500`, `indigo-600`) or neutral slate colors with opacity. DO NOT use `indigo-200` or `indigo-700`+ for primary themed elements, as they will appear in the default blue color across all themes.

## Current Status
- **Current Version:** v9.0.4
- **Last Update Date:** 2026-06-23
- **Last Update Time:** 03:15:00

## Dark Themes Definition
The following themes are considered "Dark Themes" and form the baseline for vibrant visual effects and high-contrast glowing elements:
- **Night** (`data-theme="night"`)
- **Forest** (`data-theme="forest"`)
- **Ocean** (`data-theme="ocean"`)

## Light Themes Definition
The following themes are considered "Light Themes" and require special CSS handling (e.g., avoiding white text on light backgrounds, using theme-aware colors for modals and charts):
- **Daylight** (`data-theme="daylight"`)
- **Warm Sun** (`state.theme === "warm"`)
- **Candy** (`state.theme === "candy"`)

## Push Notification Troubleshooting Protocols
Due to inconsistencies in Web Push delivery in various environments (Iframes, PWAs), follow this hierarchy:
1. **Execution Context:** Web Push is often blocked in cross-origin IFRAMES. Always test by opening the app in a **New Tab** or as an **Installed PWA**.
2. **Direct Permission Check:** Verify address bar shows "Allowed". 
3. **Service Worker Console:** Switch to `Application -> Service Workers -> Inspect` in DevTools to see SW-specific logs (`[Service Worker]`). Main console may skip these.
4. **OS Level:** Check Windows Focus Assist or macOS Do Not Disturb.
5. **Direct API Test:** Use the "Test Local Notification (Direct)" tool in Developer settings. If this fails, the browser/OS is blocking notifications globally.
6. **VAPID Integrity:** If VAPID keys change, "Clear Server Sub" + "Reset Service Worker" is mandatory.


## Task History

- **v9.0.4 (2026-06-23):** Force Check-in Fix & UI Slider Styling
  - *Bugfix:* Bypassed completeSession logic during manual Routine Tracker check-ins to directly append the session into local history. This guarantees a forced check-in completes accurately regardless of dungeon progression states, whilst omitting game rewards to prevent cheating. Popover now correctly closes after submission to offer immediate UI feedback.
  - *UI Adjustment:* Extracted HTML Range slider styles across the application settings panel. Thrice thickened the track visually (8px height) and integrated dynamic CSS linear-gradients to distinctly differentiate the covered (slid) and uncovered (unslid) regions for both WebKit & Firefox natively based on element value percentages.

- **v9.0.3 (2026-06-23):** Scrollbar OS Overrides & Check-in UTC Bug
  - *Bugfix:* Patched WebKit scrollbars ignoring customizations on Chrome 121+ by disabling the generic CSS `scrollbar-color` specification on non-Firefox browsers. The scrollbars will now properly retain theme `border-radius` and `background-clip` padding.
  - *Bugfix:* Forced `RoutineCellEditor` to synthesize timestamps via explicit physical `Date.UTC` mappings instead of looping an OS localizer. Fixes checks silently failing to commit on select time zones due to off-by-one mismatches.

- **v9.0.2 (2026-06-23):** Scrollbar & Routine Check-in Fix
  - *Bugfix:* Re-wrote routine manual check-in target timestamp synthesis to guarantee that the converted physical timezone mapped exactly to the user's selected grid-box timeframe.
  - *Bugfix:* Extracted custom scrollbar global CSS mapping (`.custom-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar`) out of Tailwind's internal `@layer base` sandbox into the global cascade layer. This patches an issue where browser native UI was preempting the style on WebKit rendering engines.

- **v9.0.1 (2026-06-23):** Heatmap Grid Quick-Add Timezone Fix
  - *Bugfix:* Fixed a critical timezone parsing bug in the Routine Tracker quick-add interface where `customTimestamp` was incorrectly converted into an ISO string via an intermediate local-time `Date` formatter, causing manual additions to silently drift backwards by a day. Manual inputs now enforce strict absolute UTC stamps.

- **v9.0.0 (2026-06-23):** Official Major Update
  - *Loot Pool Config:* Added Fixed/Free Loot Pool modes. Fixed Mode restricts edits to maintain a default 100-point balanced experience across 6 rarities while allowing customizations to text descriptions. Free mode preserves previous setups.
  - *Performance:* Decoupled the timer state using Zustand. It significantly boosts performance by preventing massive VDOM re-renders during countdowns.
  - *Notes & Reflections:* Users can now log study notes directly at the end of sessions. Added features to edit previous notes, hashtag filters, and automatic integration into daily reflections.
  - *Routine Tracker:* Revamped Routine Tracker to allow adding stats, inline duration editing, and hiding tasks. Includes a detailed full-screen stats view with date ranges.
  - *Fellowship Tools:* Captains can now Reclaim captaincy if they leave and rejoin. Captains can also directly Banish (Kick) inactive members, syncing stats immediately.
  - *UI & Polish:* Re-enabled theme-aware custom scrollbars. Added Merchant Outpost shortcut, adjusted Alchemy scaling multiplier (+15%), and re-scaled Grandmaster rank boundary.
