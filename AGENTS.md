# Project Tracker & Agent Instructions

## Role & Workflow
You are an AI assistant maintaining the "Scholar's Dungeon" project. 
At the start of every interaction, you automatically read this file (injected into your system prompt).

**CRITICAL RULE FOR EVERY UPDATE:**
We now separate updates into **Preview Updates** (预览更新) and **Official Updates** (正式更新):

**1. Preview Updates (预览更新 - Default):**
- Update the `APP_VERSION` in `src/version.ts`.
- Update the `Current Version` and `Last Update Date` in this `AGENTS.md` file.
- Log the completed task in the `Task History` section below.
- *Do not* modify `RELEASE_HISTORY` in `src/version.ts` or `public/version.json`.

**2. Official Updates (正式更新 - Only when requested):**
- Do all the steps for Preview Updates.
- Aggregate all features/fixes logged in `AGENTS.md` since the last Official Update.
- Write a comprehensive changelog summarizing these updates.
- Update `RELEASE_HISTORY` in `src/version.ts` with this aggregated changelog.
- Update `public/version.json` with the new version and changelog to trigger the app update popup.

**VERSIONING POLICY (x.y.z):**
- **x (Major):** Critical architectural changes or full-scale system overhauls.
- **y (Minor):** New features, significant UI additions, or functional enhancements.
- **z (Patch):** Bug fixes, micro-optimizations, documentation updates, and UI refinements.

**COMMUNICATION RULE:**
- You MUST ALWAYS reply to the user in Chinese (Simplified). This is an absolute requirement for every response you give.

**CSS & UI STANDARDS:**
- **Strict English UI Standard:** All UI elements across the application (labels, titles, headings, buttons, badges, tabs, tooltips, placeholders, modal dialogs, and settings descriptions) MUST strictly and exclusively be in English. NEVER use Chinese characters or bilingual slash labels (such as `English / 中文`) in the application interface or code. (Note: The assistant still replies to the user in Chinese (Simplified) during chat interactions, but the app UI itself is 100% pure English).
- **Full-Screen Modals:** Whenever creating a "full-screen" centered modal (especially `fixed inset-0`), you MUST use `createPortal(..., document.body)` from `react-dom` to render the modal directly on the `body`. If you do not use `createPortal`, parent elements with CSS `transform`, `filter`, or `perspective` will establish unintended containing blocks that capture the `fixed` positioning, causing the modal to appear in the middle of a scrolling page container instead of the actual screen view. Never make this mistake again.
- **Italic Clipping:** To prevent right-side clipping of italic text (especially in browsers with tight bounding boxes), always add a small right padding (e.g., `pr-1` or `px-0.5`) to the element or its immediate container.
- **Red Dot / Notification Placement:** Unread message or notification badges (red dots) on icons and buttons MUST ALWAYS be placed in the bottom-right corner (e.g. `absolute -bottom-0.5 -right-0.5`), NEVER in the top-right corner.
- **Touch-Friendly Controls:** Delete buttons or other critical actions MUST NOT be hover-only (e.g. `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`), as this is unfriendly to touch-screen users. They should be visible or adapt properly for mobile devices.
- **Theme-Aware Colors & Minimalist UI:** We have 6 different theme colors. Every color choice (especially backgrounds, progress bars, or buttons) MUST consider all themes to maintain a minimalist and premium aesthetic. Avoid thick, flashy, or hardcoded colors like `bg-emerald-500` which may look jarring or "rough" (粗率) in certain themes. Rely on theme-aware colors (`indigo-300`, `indigo-400`, `indigo-500`, `indigo-600`) or neutral slate colors with opacity. DO NOT use `indigo-200` or `indigo-700`+ for primary themed elements, as they will appear in the default blue color across all themes.

## Current Status
- **Current Version:** v9.1.4
- **Last Update Date:** 2026-09-03
- **Last Update Time:** 04:45:00

## Dark Themes Definition
The following themes are considered "Dark Themes" and form the baseline for vibrant visual effects and high-contrast glowing elements:
- **Night** (`data-theme="night"`)
- **Forest** (`data-theme="forest"`)
- **Ocean** (`data-theme="ocean"`)

## Light Themes Definition
The following themes are considered "Light Themes" and require special CSS handling (e.g., avoiding white text on light backgrounds, using theme-aware colors for modals and charts):
- **Daylight** (`data-theme="daylight"`)
- **Warm Sun** (`state.theme === "warm"`)
- **Candy** (`state.theme === "candy"`)

## Push Notification Troubleshooting Protocols
Due to inconsistencies in Web Push delivery in various environments (Iframes, PWAs), follow this hierarchy:
1. **Execution Context:** Web Push is often blocked in cross-origin IFRAMES. Always test by opening the app in a **New Tab** or as an **Installed PWA**.
2. **Direct Permission Check:** Verify address bar shows "Allowed". 
3. **Service Worker Console:** Switch to `Application -> Service Workers -> Inspect` in DevTools to see SW-specific logs (`[Service Worker]`). Main console may skip these.
4. **OS Level:** Check Windows Focus Assist or macOS Do Not Disturb.
5. **Direct API Test:** Use the "Test Local Notification (Direct)" tool in Developer settings. If this fails, the browser/OS is blocking notifications globally.
6. **VAPID Integrity:** If VAPID keys change, "Clear Server Sub" + "Reset Service Worker" is mandatory.


## Task History

- **v9.1.4 (2026-09-03):** Fellowship Member Auto-Healing & "Not a member" Resolution
  - *Multi-Factor Member Resolution (`api/teams.ts`):* Implemented `resolveMember` engine supporting fallback resolution across `userId`, `userUniqueId`, and `userName`. Even if client `secretCode` / session identity shifts across devices or clears, existing guild members are seamlessly recognized.
  - *Automatic Self-Healing & Member Migration:* When a member is resolved via their persistent `userUniqueId` or matching `userName`, the system automatically migrates their Redis membership record and active proposal votes to their current session key, completely eliminating 403 "Not a member" errors.
  - *Universal Action Coverage:* Wired `resolveMember` across all guild endpoints (`GET team`, `join`, `message`, `event`, `settings`, `vote`, `handle_applicant`, `leave`, `transfer`, `kick`, `reclaim`).
  - *Client Identity Resiliency:* Updated focus session broadcast and guild member interactions (`TeamModule.tsx`, `useGameState.ts`) to reliably transmit `userUniqueId` and fallback identity codes.

- **v9.1.3 (2026-09-03):** Restore Vibrant Light Theme Accent Colors
  - *Accent Palette Restoration:* Completely removed the artificial dark/inverted color overrides (`amber`, `emerald`, `rose`, `indigo`, `blue`, etc.) in Daylight, Warm Sun, and Candy light themes.
  - *Record Page Vibrancy:* Restored the original bright, vibrant, and clean tones for Gold (amber-400), Exp (indigo-400), Time (emerald-400), and Distracted (rose-400) stats cards, eliminating the dull and muddy appearance.

- **v9.1.2 (2026-09-03):** True Silent Cloud Sync & Modal Suppression
  - *Conflict Modal Suppression on Auto-Sync:* Updated `decideCloudSyncAction` with an explicit `isAutoSync` flag. When auto-sync (Immediate, Debounce, Interval Polling, or Visibility API) runs for the same device identity, it favors silent upload instead of raising a conflict modal.
  - *Background Check Modal Guard:* In `checkCloudSync`, guarded against interrupting the user with the "Echoes of the Past Found" modal when performing background or return-to-tab checks on the same device.
  - *Concurrency & Race Condition Elimination:* Added `activeCheckRequestRef` to decouple check requests from write/sync requests, preventing stale or out-of-order check responses from overwriting the UI state or popping up spurious modals while local edits are occurring.
  - *Dirty State Visibility Check:* Bypassed tab-return `checkCloudSync` when local uncommitted edits are pending (`hasUnsyncedChanges`), giving priority to auto-sync to save changes silently.

- **v9.1.1 (2026-09-03):** Light Theme UI Readability & Export Button
  - *Export Layout Fix:* Moved the Export button to the left of the Date Navigator in the Journal banner for better ergonomic flow.
  - *Export Button Contrast:* Replaced the purple transparent styling of the Export button with high-contrast theme-aware slate styling to ensure it remains legible in light themes like Candy.
  - *Global Light Theme Contrast Fix:* Implemented a sweeping fix for low-contrast text across all light themes (Candy, Daylight, Warm). We algorithmically inverted the standard Tailwind accent color scales (indigo, emerald, amber, rose, purple, sky, red, blue) exclusively for light themes. This ensures that any component using transparent colored backgrounds with colored text (e.g., `text-indigo-400` on `bg-indigo-500/10`) automatically uses a darker, highly readable text color on light backgrounds, solving hundreds of readability issues globally.

- **v9.1.0 (2026-09-02):** Dark Theme Splash Screen Optimization
  - *Color Palette Harmony:* Removed the clashing amber/yellow colors from the Sunrise special splash screen in Dark Mode.
  - *Unified Branding:* Enforced the clean, high-contrast `indigo` branding colors (indigo-400 text/icons, indigo-500/50 dividers, slate-400 subtitle) across all splash variants to ensure visual consistency and elegance in Night/Forest/Ocean themes.
  - *Animated Sunrise Glyph:* Replaced the circular `AppIcon` logo with a custom-built, highly elegant `motion.svg` animated `Sunrise` line-drawing effect specifically for the Start of the Day splash screen, delivering a premium sketching visual.
  - *Session Note Import Formatting:* Prefixed automatically imported session notes with a markdown bullet (`- `) to ensure they are neatly formatted as list items within the daily reflection.
  - *Batch Export Modal:* Added a new 'Export' button to the Journal banner, allowing users to export their daily logs. Users can specify a date range and choose to merge all logs into a single Markdown file or export them as separate files in a ZIP archive.

- **v9.0.100 (2026-09-02):** Reflection Editor Header Clean-up & Export/Import
  - *Title Simplification:* Renamed "Immersive Reflection" to "Reflection".
  - *Clutter Removal:* Removed the redundant "WYSIWYG ACTIVE" badge from the editor header.
  - *Template Controls Consolidation:* Moved the "Blank" and "Example" template mode toggle buttons directly inside the Templates dropdown menu to save toolbar space across all modal views.
  - *Import/Export Action:* Added dedicated markdown file Upload/Import and Download/Export buttons inside the Reflection header toolbar.

- **v9.0.99 (2026-09-02):** Obsidian-Style Live WYSIWYG Markdown Editor
  - *Unified Single-Pane Editor:* Completely replaced the outdated raw-text + split-preview Markdown editing architecture with a true Obsidian-style Live Preview WYSIWYG editor using TipTap and `tiptap-markdown`. 
  - *Render While Writing:* Users can now write naturally with Markdown shortcuts (e.g. `# Heading`, `**bold**`, `> quote`) and see them rendered instantly in-place, eliminating the need for a secondary preview pane.
  - *Universal Deployment:* Integrated the new unified `MarkdownEditor` across all journal interfaces including `ImmersiveReflectionModal`, `JournalView` Quick Edit, `DailySummaryModal`, and `StartOfDayModal`.
  - *Toolbar Sync:* Kept the immersive toolbar completely functional, mapping directly to TipTap chain commands for seamless rich-text formatting.

- **v9.0.99 (2026-09-02):** Concise Tooltips & Parameter Descriptions
  - *Concise Parameters:* Stripped out all overly verbose explanatory texts from the "Adjustable Parameters" configuration section, making it extremely minimalist and easy to read.
  - *Record Bubble Efficiency Fix:* Resolved a critical bug where the Stats (Record) page's hover tooltip (bubble) incorrectly displayed the raw star score (e.g. `3.5`) for Efficiency instead of the expected percentage format. The popover now accurately renders efficiency as a percentage (e.g., `70.0%`).

- **v9.0.99 (2026-09-02):** Efficiency Details Modal Restructuring
  - *Banner Result Integration:* Removed the bulky standalone "Resulting Rating" card entirely, instead embedding the final calculated efficiency or star rating cleanly into the top modal banner for immediate, unobstructed visibility.
  - *Side-by-Side Formula Breakdown:* Overhauled the "Active Mathematical Formula" section. Instead of a single column of abstract formulas, it now features a responsive `flex-row` side-by-side layout: the left side displays the mathematical equation, while the right side displays the exact live values plugged in for that step (e.g. `min(4.2h / 8.0h) = 52.5%`).
  - *Redundancy Removal:* Eliminated the `Star Rating = Efficiency * 5` row from the active mathematical steps to keep the panel focused purely on the core weightings.

- **v9.0.99 (2026-09-02):** Efficiency Formula Display Optimization
  - *Unified Formula Syntax Coloring (`EfficiencyDetailsModal.tsx`):* Added rigorous, color-coded variable highlighting (`text-emerald-400` for Efficiency, `text-indigo-400` for Completion Rate, `text-sky-400` for Focus Degree) across all steps of the Active Mathematical Formula to visually link parameters with their calculated outputs.
  - *Formula Accuracy Correction:* Corrected a visual math typo where the formula mistakenly displayed `Completion Rate × (70% + 30% × Focus Degree)`, updating it to accurately reflect the true weighted codebase formula: `(Completion Rate × 70%) + (Focus Degree × 30%)`.
  - *Removed Stale Rounding Text:* Stripped the `(Rounded to 0.5★)` sub-text from the Star Rating formula, reflecting the recent underlying high-precision tracking logic update.

- **v9.0.99 (2026-09-02):** Efficiency Rounding Precision Fix & Sound Deduplication
  - *Calculation Precision (`JournalView.tsx`, `DailySummaryModal.tsx`):* Changed the core calculated rating to preserve exact decimal values instead of unnecessarily snapping to the nearest 0.5.
  - *UI Decimal Formatting:* Updated percentage displays to accurately reflect a single decimal place precision (e.g. `68.4%`), providing significantly more granular progression feedback, while stripping any trailing zeros for cleaner visuals.
  - *Star Visual Integrity (`EfficiencyDetailsModal.tsx`):* Maintained the logic that rounds visual SVG stars (Full or Half) to the nearest 0.5 solely for UI rendering purposes without permanently distorting the underlying data value.
  - *Sound Optimization:* Removed a redundant `playSound('reward')` call that was overlapping with the newly implemented `calculate` chime when using the manual calculate button.

- **v9.0.95 (2026-09-02):** Dedicated Magic Chime Sound for Efficiency Calculation
  - *Calculation Specific Audio (`sound.ts`):* Implemented a brand new `'calculate'` audio profile featuring a rapid, high-pitch magical chime arpeggio specifically designed for the efficiency auto-calculate action.
  - *Audio Separation (`JournalView.tsx`, `DailySummaryModal.tsx`):* Decoupled the auto-calculate action from the global `'success'` timer completion sound to ensure the timer's victory sound remains exclusive and distinguished.

- **v9.0.94 (2026-09-02):** Zero-Data Efficiency Formula Fix & Icon-Only Calculate Action
  - *Zero-Data Formula Correction (`JournalView.tsx`, `DailySummaryModal.tsx`, `EfficiencyDetailsModal.tsx`):* Fixed the formula anomaly where days with 0 focus minutes previously defaulted to 30% efficiency because 0 distractions per hour incorrectly assigned full focus quality weight (`focusDegree = 1.0`). When focus duration is 0, calculated efficiency is now strictly 0 and the display clearly presents `None`.
  - *Icon-Only Calculate Button (`JournalView.tsx`):* Removed the `"Calculate"` text label from the efficiency card, turning it into a clean, minimalist `p-1.5` square icon button (`<Calculator />`) that seamlessly mirrors the formula customization button (`<SlidersHorizontal />`).

- **v9.0.93 (2026-09-02):** Realistic Central-Spine Book Page-Turn Dynamics
  - *Spine-Anchored Split-Spread Architecture (`JournalView.tsx`):* Decoupled the dual-page book spread into two independent page sub-layers anchored by a stationary central leather spine and stitching ribbon.
  - *Realistic Unidirectional Page Turning:* When turning forward (`Next Entry` / right arrow), the right page flips along the center spine (`transformOrigin: 'left center'`, 3D `rotateY: 28deg -> 0deg`) while the left page remains steady. When turning backward (`Previous Entry` / left arrow), the left page flips along the spine (`transformOrigin: 'right center'`, 3D `rotateY: -28deg -> 0deg`) while the right page remains steady.
  - *Spine-Emanating Paper Lighting Shimmer:* Dynamic ambient paper gradient sweeps outward naturally from the central binding crease upon page turn.
  - *Zero-Lag GPU Compositing:* Powered entirely by CSS 3D perspectives (`perspective: 1400px`, `transformStyle: 'preserve-3d'`, and `will-change-transform`), ensuring smooth 60fps/120fps response with zero layout thrashing or stutter.

- **v9.0.92 (2026-09-02):** Realistic & High-Performance 3D Book Page-Turn Dynamics
  - *Authentic 3D Paper Curvature (`JournalView.tsx`):* Upgraded the flat 2D slide animation to an authentic 3D book spread turn utilizing hardware-accelerated CSS 3D perspectives (`perspective: 1600px`, dynamic `rotateY`, `transformOrigin` pinned to spine edges, and subtle depth scaling `0.985 -> 1`).
  - *Dynamic Page Turn Light Shimmer:* Added a soft, GPU-accelerated paper fold shimmer gradient that sweeps dynamically in the direction of the turn, recreating natural ambient light reflection across turning parchment.
  - *Zero-Overhead Performance:* Powered purely by browser GPU composited transforms and cubic-bezier easing (`ease: [0.22, 1, 0.36, 1]`, duration 0.32s), delivering instant 60fps/120fps tactile response with zero DOM thrashing or lag.

- **v9.0.91 (2026-09-02):** Patchouli Bookmark Seamless Attachment & Date Typography Color Parity
  - *Seamless Tome Attachment (`JournalView.tsx`):* Anchored the bookmark tabs stack directly inside the Tome main container (`absolute left-full top-8 -ml-px`), completely eliminating the 12px separation gap and making the tabs stick out directly from the book's leather border.
  - *Bookmark Typography Color Parity:* Configured both the month (`monthText: 'text-indigo-100 font-bold'`) and date (`dateText: 'text-indigo-100 font-black'`) in selected tabs to share the same clean, high-contrast light color, resolving the issue where the day number (e.g. `03`) appeared dark/brownish in light/warm themes.

- **v9.0.90 (2026-09-02):** Restore Original Splash Screen Style & Typography Color Parity
  - *Restored Original Classic Splash Layout (`SplashScreen.tsx`):* Restored the user's preferred classic, minimalist splash structure featuring the centered `AppIcon (size 80)`, `text-3xl font-bold text-indigo-400 tracking-widest uppercase` title, smooth animated accent divider (`h-0.5 bg-indigo-500/50`), and `text-slate-400` subtitle.
  - *Eliminated Chunky White Font & Glare on Special Splash:* Completely removed all white text overlays and chunky background blobs from special splash mode, ensuring the title and subtitles retain high contrast and clean branding colors (`text-indigo-400` / `text-slate-400`).

- **v9.0.89 (2026-09-02):** Efficiency Subtitle Feedback Removal & Section Header Renaming Parity
  - *Redundant Subtitle Removal (`JournalView.tsx`, `DailySummaryModal.tsx`):* Completely eliminated the animated `Score: XX%` / `Score: XX% · X.X★` sub-line from under the rating cards when clicking Calculate, preventing visual clutter and overlapping frames.
  - *Header Renaming Parity:* Renamed "Daily Assessment" to clean **"Log"** in `JournalView`, and renamed "Daily Feelings" to **"Feelings"** across `JournalView`, `DailySummaryModal`, and `Stats`.
  - *Auto-Calculate Icon Update:* Replaced the sparkle icon `<Sparkles />` with a mathematical calculator icon `<Calculator />` for the Auto-Calculate action across both `JournalView` and `DailySummaryModal`.

- **v9.0.88 (2026-09-02):** Journal Reflection Header Simplification & Redundancy Removal
  - *Title Simplification (`JournalView.tsx`):* Renamed the right page header from "Daily Chronicle" to clean "Reflection".
  - *Minimalist Icon-Only Header Actions:* Converted the top action controls (Quick Edit `<Edit3 />`, Immersive Editor `<Maximize2 />`, Export `<Download />`, Copy `<Copy />`) into clean, icon-only button squares with descriptive tooltips, removing wordy text labels.
  - *Empty State Redundancy Removal:* Removed the duplicate action buttons ("Quick Write" & "Immersive Editor") from the center of the Unwritten Parchment empty state, keeping the interface uncluttered and relying on the unified top toolbar.

- **v9.0.87 (2026-09-02):** Light Theme Button Contrast & Hover State Readability Overhaul
  - *Auto-Calculate Button Contrast Fix (`JournalView.tsx`, `DailySummaryModal.tsx`):* Replaced transparent `bg-indigo-500/15 text-indigo-300 hover:text-indigo-200` with high-contrast theme-aware slate styling (`bg-slate-800 hover:bg-slate-700/90 border-slate-700/70 text-slate-300 hover:text-slate-100`). This completely eliminates washed-out text on hover in Light Themes (`Daylight`, `Warm Sun`, `Candy`) while maintaining sleek contrast in Dark Themes.
  - *Defer to Chest Button Contrast Fix (`Timer.tsx`):* Replaced low-contrast `bg-emerald-600/20 text-emerald-400` with unified, high-contrast dark slate capsule button (`bg-slate-900/90 hover:bg-slate-800 border-slate-700/80 text-slate-200 hover:text-white`) with amber chest icon, ensuring crisp legibility across all 6 themes.
  - *Explore View Reward Chest Trigger Button Styling (`ExploreView.tsx`):* Harmonized chest trigger button styling to theme-aware slate capsule (`bg-slate-800/80 text-amber-400`).

- **v9.0.86 (2026-09-02):** Sleek Stationery Book Index Tab Geometry & Clean Theme-Adaptive Palette
  - *Sleek Index Tab Geometry:* Replaced bulky half-capsule/sausage domes (`rounded-r-2xl`) with crisp, compact stationery index tabs (`w-11 py-2 px-1 rounded-r-md` with flat top/bottom and subtle 6px corner radius), cleanly sticking out from the tome leather border.
  - *Refined Color Palette Across All Themes:* Configured inactive tabs with crisp slate borders and soft slate backgrounds (`bg-slate-900/95 border-slate-800`), and selected tabs with vibrant solid theme indigo (`bg-indigo-600 border-indigo-400 text-white shadow-md`), eliminating muddy gradients and washed-out halos in light themes.
  - *Minimalist Quick Bookmark & Delete Action:* Streamlined the top quick bookmark button to match the sleek `rounded-r-md` geometry with an elegant amber accent, and refined the mini delete button.

- **v9.0.85 (2026-09-02):** Refined Grimoire Bookmark Palette, Responsive Mood Glyphs & Minimalist Efficiency Header
  - *Refined Grimoire Bookmark Tabs:* Replaced harsh electric violet/blue and bright orange bookmark tabs with elegant, subtle dark grimoire leather/slate tones (`bg-slate-900/95` and `bg-slate-850/95` with delicate slate borders and high-contrast font-mono dates; selected state features refined indigo theme glow with left accent notch). Quick bookmark tab upgraded to a subtle slate tab with glowing amber fill icon on bookmark.
  - *Responsive Daily Feelings Glyphs:* Configured mood selection buttons on narrower containers/screens to cleanly hide text labels (`hidden 2xl:block` / `hidden sm:block`) and center mood icons vertically, completely eliminating truncated text strings like `GR...` or `OK...`.
  - *Streamlined Efficiency Header & Subtitle Removal:* Renamed all instances of "Efficiency Rating" to "Efficiency" across `JournalView`, `DailySummaryModal`, and `Stats`, and removed the redundant bottom subtitle line ("20% Efficiency · Light Session") from rating cards for clean minimalism.

- **v9.0.84 (2026-09-02):** Markdown Ordered List Numbers & Text Contrast Fix Across All Themes
  - *Comprehensive Theme-Aware Typography Variables (`index.css`):* Bound `--tw-prose-counters`, `--tw-prose-invert-counters`, `--tw-prose-body`, `--tw-prose-invert-body`, `--tw-prose-bullets`, and `--tw-prose-headings` directly to theme variables `var(--color-slate-*)`.
  - *High-Contrast Markers & Text:* Explicitly enforced `color: var(--color-slate-200) !important` and `font-weight: 700` for `ol > li::marker`, and `color: var(--color-slate-300) !important` for bullet list markers, completely resolving the washed-out / faint text issue on Light Themes (`Warm Sun`, `Daylight`, `Candy`) and maintaining crisp readability on Dark Themes.
  - *Unified Component Classes:* Updated `ImmersiveReflectionModal`, `JournalView`, `DailySummaryModal`, `StartOfDayModal`, and `Stats` with explicit `text-slate-200 prose-p:text-slate-200 prose-li:text-slate-200 prose-ol:text-slate-200 prose-ul:text-slate-200 marker:text-slate-200 marker:font-bold`.

- **v9.0.83 (2026-09-02):** Patchouli Bookmark Tabs Layout Fix & Theme Alternating Palette
  - *Full Render & Layout Integrity:* Added dedicated right-padding offset (`pr-0 md:pr-14`) to the tome container and positioned bookmark tabs cleanly at `absolute right-0 top-10`, preventing screen overflow, clipping, or incomplete rendering across all viewports.
  - *Theme Dark & Light Alternating Colors:* Replaced static color array with dynamic theme-aware alternating cycles (`index % 2 === 0` for Theme Dark `indigo-600`, `index % 2 === 1` for Theme Light `indigo-400`), ensuring 100% theme-adaptive contrast and aesthetic harmony.
  - *Banner Clutter Removal:* Completely removed the redundant bookmark button from the top banner header, keeping the top bar focused purely on date navigation and back action.
  - *Refined Tooltips & Actions:* Positioned tab hover tooltips to pop out inward towards the tome, preventing any edge clipping.

- **v9.0.82 (2026-09-02):** Immersive Reflection Interface Unification, Markdown Shortcuts & Patchouli Bookmark Tabs
  - *Unified Immersive Reflection Modal (`ImmersiveReflectionModal.tsx`):*
    - Standardized the Immersive Reflection interface across all views (`JournalView`, `DailySummaryModal`, `StartOfDayModal`, `Stats`).
    - **Markdown Editing Shortcuts:** Added hotkeys for `Ctrl/Cmd + B` (Bold), `Ctrl/Cmd + I` (Italic), `Ctrl/Cmd + U` (Underline), `Ctrl/Cmd + K` (Link), `Ctrl/Cmd + E` (Code/Inline Code), `Ctrl/Cmd + Shift + X/S` (Strikethrough), and `Tab` (2-space soft indent).
    - **Expanded Header Markdown Toolbar:** Added quick formatting glyphs for H1, H2, H3 headings, bullet list (`- `), blockquote (`> `), inline/block code, and links with auto-selection wrapping and cursor placement.
  - *Patchouli Side-Index Bookmark Tabs (`JournalView.tsx`):*
    - Added Patchouli-style right-side bookmark index tabs sticking out from the journal leather tome edge on desktop with palette cycling colors and date pills (`MMM dd`).
    - Added one-click Add/Remove bookmark action in the header banner and on the side tabs with hover quick-delete triggers (`<Trash2 />`).
    - Added horizontal bookmark strip on mobile devices for fast switching between bookmarked entries.
    - Persistent bookmark storage in `AppState.journalBookmarks`.
  - *Clutter Removal:* Removed `Page I` and `Page II` label pills from the journal tome spread, creating a cleaner reading atmosphere.

- **v9.0.81 (2026-09-02):** Minecraft Patchouli Style Open-Tome Journal Redesign
  - *Tome / Open Book Layout Structure:* Transformed the Journal view below the banner into an immersive, open-book spread (Left Page & Right Page) inspired by Minecraft Patchouli / Arcane Scholar's Grimoire with central binding crease, leather cover border, and bookmark ribbon styling.
  - *Page I (Left Page - Daily Assessment & Focus Vitals):*
    - **Daily Feelings (`<Heart />`):** Elegant interactive mood glyph selectors with active glow.
    - **Efficiency Rating (`<Star />`):** Prominent rating display (Stars or Efficiency % mode), live auto-calculation trigger (`<Sparkles />`), and parameter formula adjustments (`<SlidersHorizontal />`).
    - **Expedition Vitals:** Compact daily lore cards showing Focus Time, Distraction counts & rate, and logged session counts.
  - *Page II (Right Page - Daily Chronicle & Reading View):*
    - **Markdown Reading Focus:** Pristine formatted Markdown reading presentation supporting soft line breaks, headings, blockquotes, lists, and code blocks.
    - **Parchment Action Suite:** One-click Fullscreen Immersive Writing Mode trigger (`<Maximize2 />`), quick inline edit mode (`<Edit3 />`), Export Markdown (`<Download />`), and clipboard copy (`<Copy />`).
    - **Unwritten Parchment State:** Atmospheric empty state with feather quill icon and direct write triggers when no reflection is logged for the day.
  - *Page Flip Navigation & Parity:* Smooth animated page-turn transitions with authentic page flip sound feedback across day-by-day navigation.

- **v9.0.80 (2026-09-02):** Markdown Soft Line Breaks Support (`remark-breaks` & `remark-gfm`)
  - *Hard Break Conversion for Single Newlines:* Installed and integrated `remark-breaks` and `remark-gfm` across all Markdown rendering views (`ImmersiveReflectionModal`, `JournalView`, `DailySummaryModal`, `StartOfDayModal`, `ShareRecordModal`, `Stats`, `DashboardView`, `SageSettingsSection`).
  - *Live Preview Parity:* Single `\n` line breaks in reflections, notes, and Sage chat responses now immediately render as `<br />` line breaks in the preview, resolving the issue where lines only broke after typing double newlines (`\n\n`).

- **v9.0.79 (2026-09-02):** Journal Banner Redesign Aligned with Agenda & Clutter Removal
  - *Unified Agenda Banner Hierarchy:* Restructured `JournalView.tsx` top banner to match `TodayView.tsx` (Agenda) typography and layout conventions (`font-black uppercase italic tracking-tighter` title with BookOpen icon, clean subtitle displaying the full formatted date).
  - *Redundancy Removal:* Eradicated the superfluous `Daily Log` pill and `Entry Logged / No Entry Yet` status badge, streamlining the header to a clean, minimal interface.
  - *Standardized Right Toolbar:* Placed the unified Date Navigator pill (`ChevronLeft`, interactive `MMMM do` DatePicker trigger, `ChevronRight`) and the standard right-aligned back button (`<ArrowLeft />`), ensuring 100% visual consistency with the Agenda page.

- **v9.0.78 (2026-08-30):** Journal Page UI Simplification & Unified Assessment Rating
  - *Unified Aesthetic & Layout Alignment:* Streamlined `JournalView.tsx` into a clean, minimalist 2-column layout adhering strictly to the Record / Stats card design language (`bg-slate-900 border border-slate-800 rounded-3xl`).
  - *Daily Assessment Module Parity:* Fully aligned the Daily Assessment module with the End of the Day modal (`DailySummaryModal.tsx`):

- **v9.0.42 (2026-08-29):** Fix Expedition Picker Auto-Dismissal, Clean DDL Task Naming & Light Theme Inversion Colors
  - *Outside Click/Tap Auto-Dismissal:* Added touch and mouse event listeners (`mousedown`, `touchstart`) on `document` in both `TodayView` and `StartOfDayModal`, ensuring clicking or tapping anywhere outside the Expedition picker popover closes it smoothly.
  - *Clean DDL Task Naming:* Resolved the task naming bug where `[Tier 1]` / `[Tier X]` was being prepended to task titles when importing expeditions with deadlines, keeping the task titles clean and matching pure expedition names (`d.name`).
  - *Theme Inversion Color Compliance:* Replaced inappropriate hardcoded `bg-slate-100` classes with theme-aware `slate-800` / `slate-900` system tokens, eliminating the solid black rectangular button artifacts on Daylight, Warm Sun, and Candy light themes.

- **v9.0.41 (2026-08-29):** One-Click Import for Yesterday's Uncompleted Tasks & Active Deadline Expeditions
  - *Smart Import Engine:* Implemented intelligent deduction and import calculation in both `TodayView` and `StartOfDayModal`, capturing ① all uncompleted manual and expedition-linked tasks from yesterday's settlement date, and ② all active expeditions that have an approaching/active deadline (DDL) set (directly or inherited from parent Major Dungeons).
  - *Deduplication & Depth Preservation:* Automatically filters out tasks already present in today's agenda or already completed in expedition records, preserving hierarchical Tier depth prefixes (`[Tier X] ...`).
  - *Minimalist Button & Badge Indicator:* Added a dedicated `CalendarClock` icon button beside the agenda input with bottom-right numerical pending count badges, informative tooltips, and theme-aware contrast styling across both Light and Dark themes.

- **v9.0.39 (2026-08-29):** Global Navigation Event Listener for StartOfDayModal
  - *Explore Navigation Fix:* Implemented a global `window.dispatchEvent(new CustomEvent('nav-to-explore'))` mechanism inside `StartOfDayModal` and a corresponding `useEffect` listener in the root `App.tsx` component. This guarantees that clicking "Focus" or "Focusing" buttons inside the full-screen modal accurately switches the application's active tab to the Explore (Timer) interface across all layouts.

- **v9.0.38 (2026-08-28):** Import Bug Fix
  - *Missing Import Fix:* Resolved an issue where `StartOfDayModal` crashed upon render due to a missing `Play` icon import from `lucide-react`, and fixed a missing `MajorDungeon` type import in `DashboardView`.

- **v9.0.37 (2026-08-28):** CSS Variable Inversion Fixes & StartOfDayModal Parity
  - *Automatic CSS Inversion Compliance:* Reverted hardcoded `bg-white` and `bg-slate-100` classes in `TodayView` and `StartOfDayModal` that were unintentionally mapping to pure black (`#0f172a`) in Daylight mode. Now correctly relying on the app's native `index.css` Tailwind CSS variable inversion, ensuring all slate colors properly map to their light/dark equivalents.
  - *StartOfDayModal Action Parity:* Added the missing `Focus` / `Focusing` action buttons directly to the `StartOfDayModal`'s "Today's Agenda" list.
  - *Action Separation:* Ensured both Agenda views (Dashboard and Modal) strictly separate "Clicking the row" (Selects the focus target silently) from "Clicking the Focus button" (Navigates to the timer screen).

- **v9.0.36 (2026-08-28):** Theme-Aware UI Refinements & Click Interaction Optimization
  - *Theme-Aware Focus Colors:* Restyled the `TodayView` selected agenda task rows to explicitly check for `isDarkTheme`. Light themes now correctly render with deep contrast text (`text-indigo-900`) and soft, legible background opacities (`bg-indigo-50`), fixing the unreadable light-blue-on-white text issues.
  - *Click-to-Select vs Click-to-Focus:* Separated interaction layers in `TodayView` and `StartOfDayModal`. Clicking anywhere on a task row now exclusively selects it as the active dungeon (`currentDungeonId`) without forcing a screen navigation. Only clicking the dedicated `Focusing` or `Focus` button will trigger the jump to the Explore/Timer interface.
  - *Emoji Eradication:* Replaced the tomato emoji (`🍅`) in `TodayView` and `StartOfDayModal` progression counts with standard pure-text UI formats `(X/Y)`, maintaining exact consistency with the `ExpeditionTreePicker` counters.

- **v9.0.35 (2026-08-28):** Hierarchical Expedition Picker & Two-Way Agenda-Expedition Focus Linking
  - *Hierarchical Expedition Tree Picker:* Integrated the multi-tier `ExpeditionTreePicker` into both `TodayView` (Agenda) and `StartOfDayModal` (Today's Agenda). Users can browse Major Goals, expandable Tier-1 / Tier-2 parent nodes, and directly pick child dungeons with session progress badges.
  - *Agenda-to-Expedition Focus Linkage:* Clicking an agenda item linked to an expedition sets it as the current active focus dungeon (`state.currentDungeonId`) and immediately navigates to Explore/Timer mode. Active focus agenda items display glowing rings, pulsing status dots, and a dedicated "Focusing" badge.
  - *Automatic Agenda Completion:* Completing an expedition (via timer focus sessions or manual force-complete) automatically marks all associated Agenda todos (`todayTodos` matching `dungeonId`) as `completed: true`.

- **v9.0.34 (2026-08-28):** Viewport-Safe Talent Tooltips with Dynamic Boundary Clamping & PopoverPortal
  - *Full Viewport Clamping & Edge Safety:* Refactored Active Talent tooltips in `ExploreView` from clipped, overflow-vulnerable relative CSS blocks to the portal-rendered `<PopoverPortal>` component with dynamic viewport horizontal boundary clamping (`Math.max(12, Math.min(window.innerWidth - popoverRect.width - 12, left))`) and vertical overflow flipping (top vs bottom placement).
  - *Dynamic Pointer Arrow:* Calculated an adaptive arrow position that smoothly tracks the icon's anchor center even when the bubble body is clamped against the screen edges.
  - *Reliable Hover & Tap Triggering:* Enabled seamless hover preview and click/tap toggles with outside-click dismissal, preventing clipped text and unusable claim buttons on all screen dimensions and mobile viewports.

- **v9.0.33 (2026-08-28):** Enhanced Timer Loop Stepper UI & Contained Stepper Chevrons
  - *Pixel-Perfect Contained Steppers:* Redesigned the `SpinnerInput` up/down stepper chevron buttons into a neatly bounded vertical dock (`absolute right-1 top-1 bottom-1 w-4.5 sm:w-5`) with rounded inner edges and crisp micro-chevrons (`size={11}`, `strokeWidth={2.5}`), completely eliminating button overflowing, misalignment, and clipping across all compact input sizes and theme modes.
  - *Smooth Infinity Cycle Transition:* Fixed the stepping logic for `allowInfinity` when `min={2}`: clicking Up on infinity (`∞`) transitions directly to the minimum value (`2`), and clicking Down from `2` transitions cleanly back to infinity (`∞`) without getting stuck.
  - *Refined Typography & Focus Rings:* Enforced dedicated right padding (`!pr-6`), distinct indigo coloring for infinity, and smooth fade-in transitions.

- **v9.0.32 (2026-08-28):** Refactor Distraction Penalty to Direct Interruption Frequency Badge (`/min`)
  - *Direct Interruption Frequency:* Replaced the negative percentage deduction indicator (`-100% Focus`) in Recent Sessions with a clear and intuitive frequency badge (`0.9/min`, `1.0/min`), directly showing `(Total Distractions / Focus Duration)` in times per minute.
  - *Clean Typography & Sizing:* Formatted the rate with a high-contrast mono number and clean `/min` unit suffix, along with an informative tooltip detailing the total interruptions and focus duration.

- **v9.0.31 (2026-08-28):** Zero-Data Y-Axis Fallback & Configurable Dynamic/Fixed Y-Axis Scale
  - *Always-Visible Zero-Data Y-Axis:* Resolved an issue where Daily and Weekly bar charts would render an empty left Y-axis when no study sessions were logged. The new `computeTimeYAxis` helper provides standard baseline reference ticks (`[0, 30m, 1h]` for Daily, `[0, 1h, 2h]` for Weekly) even on days with 0 minutes recorded.
  - *Y-Axis Scale Mode Setting:* Added a "Y-Axis Scale" configuration toggle (`Dynamic Max` vs `Fixed Max`) in Record Dashboard Layout settings (`ViewSettingsModal`), allowing users to choose between content-adaptive scaling and fixed standard maximums (4h for Daily, 8h for Weekly).
  - *Unified Tick Formatting:* Applied consistent time tick generation across dynamic steps (15m, 30m, 1h, 2h, 3h) and fixed steps with zero axis clipping.

- **v9.0.30 (2026-08-28):** Enable Y-Axis on Weekly Efficiency Trend Chart
  - *Visible Efficiency Y-Axis:* Added an explicit, styled Y-axis to the Weekly Efficiency Trend `<LineChart>` with integer star rating ticks (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`), clean slate typography (`text-slate-500` / `#64748b`), and zero-border minimalism.
  - *Unified Grid Alignment:* Synchronized chart margins and Y-axis width (`width={32}`, `margin={{ top: 12, right: weeklyLayerMode === 'both' ? 12 : 16, left: 0, bottom: 0 }}`) with the Weekly Activity Bar chart above, ensuring pixel-perfect horizontal alignment of gridlines and X-axis labels across both charts.
  - *Refined Trend Line Node Styling:* Updated the line node styling (`stroke: '#ffffff'`, `strokeWidth: 1.5`, `isAnimationActive: false`) for crisp visibility and zero clip-path animation anomalies.

- **v9.0.29 (2026-08-28):** Widen Daily Tooltip Popover & Lightweight Popover Entrance Animation
  - *Unified Card Width:* Widened the Daily activity chart popover tooltip (`CustomDailyTooltip`) from `min-w-[140px]` to `w-[200px] sm:w-[220px]` (matching the Weekly chart and Activity Heatmap popovers).
  - *Spacious Distraction Layout:* Increased internal horizontal spacing (`p-3.5 sm:p-4` and `gap-4`) so "Distracted" and the count / hourly rate `(x.x/h)` now breathe comfortably with no overlapping or cramped wrapping.
  - *Smooth Entrance Animation:* Implemented a hardware-accelerated `.animate-popover-enter` keyframe animation (`160ms cubic-bezier(0.16, 1, 0.3, 1)` with `scale(0.94) translateY(4px)` to `scale(1) translateY(0)`), giving all chart and calendar tooltip bubbles a silky-smooth, fluid appearance without performance lag or layout shifts.

- **v9.0.28 (2026-08-28):** Strict Tooltip Active-State Mutual Exclusion & Popover Isolation
  - *Strict Mutual Exclusion via `activeChart` State:* Added an explicit `activeChart` state (`'daily' | 'weeklyBar' | 'weeklyLine' | 'sleep' | null`) to coordinate all tooltip components. Custom tooltips (`CustomWeeklyTooltip`, `CustomDailyTooltip`, `CustomSleepTooltip`) now verify `activeChart === chartId` before returning popover JSX, rendering `null` if any other chart is active.
  - *Zero Dual-Tooltip Guarantee:* Clicking Weekly Activity Bar immediately restricts active tooltips to `weeklyBar`, forcing Weekly Efficiency Trend to return `null` even if Recharts retains internal active hover states (and vice-versa).
  - *Complete Click-Outside Cleanup:* Resetting `activeChart` to `null` on outside interactions or clicks on empty chart space instantly closes all active popovers.

- **v9.0.27 (2026-08-28):** Chart Root Component Key-Binding for Mutually Exclusive Tooltips & Reliable Outside Click Dismissal
  - *Chart Root Key-Binding:* Relocated `chartKeys` from child `<Tooltip>` components directly onto the parent `<ComposedChart key={chartKeys.xxx}>` and `<LineChart key={chartKeys.xxx}>` components. When changing keys, Recharts' internal chart state (`isTooltipActive`) is cleanly remounted and reset to `false`.
  - *Weekly Chart Mutual Exclusion:* In `handleChartClick`, clicking an element in the Weekly Activity Bar chart immediately regenerates `chartKeys.weeklyLine` (and vice-versa), ensuring only one chart's popover can exist at any time.
  - *Reliable Click-Outside Auto-Dismissal:* In `handleOutsideInteraction`, clicking anywhere outside active chart containers and popover contents resets all chart keys, immediately closing all open tooltips.

- **v9.0.26 (2026-08-28):** Click-Outside Popover Auto-Dismissal & Mutually Exclusive Chart Tooltips
  - *Reliable Click-Outside Dismissal:* Refined `handleOutsideInteraction` click target detection to check for interactive SVG elements (`recharts-bar-rectangle`, `recharts-dot`, `recharts-sector`, `g.recharts-layer`, `recharts-cartesian-axis-tick`) instead of entire chart wrapper bounds. Clicking anywhere outside active chart items (empty page, other cards, whitespace in or out of chart) now immediately closes open popovers.
  - *Mutually Exclusive Chart Popovers:* In `handleChartClick`, whenever a data point or category is clicked on any chart (such as Weekly Activity Bar or Weekly Efficiency Trend), all other charts' `chartKeys` are immediately regenerated, ensuring that only one chart tooltip can be open at any given moment.

- **v9.0.25 (2026-08-28):** Fix Daily Distractions Mode Bar Isolation, Cursor Ghost Columns & 0-Data Popover Stability
  - *Distractions-Only Bar Isolation:* Explicitly mapped `<Cell fill="transparent" fillOpacity={0} stroke="transparent" />` to hit-box `<Bar>` elements in `Distractions` (lines) mode in both Daily and Weekly charts, completely eliminating unintentional colored session bars from leaking into the Distractions view.
  - *Eliminate Lingering Cursor Ghost Highlight:* Removed Recharts `cursor={{ fill: ... }}` background highlight (`cursor={false}`) across Daily, Weekly, and Sleep charts, preventing any grey columns from remaining visible after popovers close.
  - *Reliable 0-Data Category Popovers:* Fixed `handleOutsideInteraction` and `handleChartClick` so clicking periods with zero recorded time or zero distractions stably opens the popover ("No activity") without premature dismissal or flickering.
  - *Data Fallback in Tooltips:* Added `allData` fallback lookups in `CustomDailyTooltip` and `CustomWeeklyTooltip` to guarantee popover rendering even when Recharts returns an empty `payload` array.

- **v9.0.24 (2026-08-28):** Fix Record Bubble Card (Popover/Tooltip) Interaction & Synchronization Bugs
  - *Single-Click Tooltip Open:* Refined `handleChartClick` so clicking data points on any chart opens the popover immediately without resetting the active chart's key or requiring a double-click.
  - *Transparent Bar Hitboxes:* Added transparent `<Bar>` overlays for `Distractions` line mode in both Daily and Weekly `ComposedChart` components, making trend line nodes effortless to click and tap on touch/mobile devices.
  - *Reliable Click-Outside Dismissal:* Enhanced the global `click` and `touchstart` listener to cleanly dismiss all popovers when clicking outside charts, popovers, or heatmap cells while preventing premature dismissal during button clicks.
  - *Scroll & Resize Synchronization:* Added listeners to dismiss open popovers during scroll or window resize events to eliminate floating detachments.
  - *Heatmap Distractions Breakdown:* Fixed missing `distractions`, `internal`, `external`, and `unavoidable` count aggregation in `renderHeatmapPopover`, ensuring full parity with Daily and Weekly card popovers.
  - *Session Details Integrity:* Passed `processedHistory` with pre-computed `assignedDateStr` and `period` into `DailySessionsModal` to guarantee accurate session listings and period breakdowns.

- **v9.0.23 (2026-08-28):** Strict English UI Standard & Clean Average Calculation Settings
  - *Strict English UI Standard:* Added a strict rule to `AGENTS.md` specifying that all UI elements across the application must strictly and exclusively be in English with zero Chinese characters or bilingual slashes.
  - *Clean Average Calculation Setting:* Removed the Chinese label suffix and the descriptive `(e.g. ...)` subtext from the "Average Calculation" section in `ViewSettingsModal.tsx`, leaving clean, minimalist buttons ("Total Days" / "Active Days").

- **v9.0.22 (2026-08-28):** Heatmap Hourly Distraction Rate & Dashboard Average Baseline Toggle
  - *Heatmap Avg/h Distraction Rate:* Updated the Distractions summary card in the Activity Heatmap from "Avg/Day" to "Avg/h", dividing total interruptions by effective study hours `(distractions / (timeOrTasks / 60))` to accurately reflect focus quality across any time scale.
  - *Dashboard Layout Average Calculation Toggle:* Added an "Average Calculation" setting in Dashboard Layout (`statsViewOpts.averageCalculationBase`), allowing users to switch whether daily averages (Avg Gold, Avg Exp, Avg Time) in Weekly and Heatmap summaries are computed using Active Days or Total Calendar Days.

- **v9.0.21 (2026-08-28):** Fix Distractions-Only Y-Axis Display in Daily and Weekly Activity Charts
  - *Clean Conditional Y-Axis Rendering:* Resolved an issue where the Distractions Y-axis did not render on the left in single-axis mode (`Distractions` only) due to multi-axis layout collisions with hidden axes. Now mounts only the active Y-axis in single mode (`yAxisId="distractions"`, `orientation="left"`), rendering integer count ticks clearly on the left.
  - *Seamless Dual/Single Mode Axis Binding:* In `Both` mode, mounts `yAxisId="time"` (left) and `yAxisId="distractions"` (right); in `Time` mode, mounts `yAxisId="time"` (left); in `Distractions` mode, mounts `yAxisId="distractions"` (left).

- **v9.0.20 (2026-08-28):** Refined Layer Selector Labels & Responsive Single/Dual Y-Axes Display
  - *Clean Layer Selector Labels:* Removed the "Layer:" prefix from the Daily and Weekly selector badges and option menus, displaying concise pills: `Both`, `Time`, and `Distractions`.
  - *Contextual Single/Dual Y-Axes:* Configured Recharts Y-axes in both Daily and Weekly charts to dynamically show values based on the active mode:
    - When single axis (`Time` or `Distractions` only): Displays the respective tick values on the left Y-axis.
    - When dual axis (`Both` mode): Left Y-axis displays formatted focus time (e.g. `30m`, `1h`), and right Y-axis displays integer distraction counts (0, 1, 2, 3...).

- **v9.0.19 (2026-08-28):** 3-Mode Layer Toggle & Deep Crimson Red for Unavoidable Distractions
  - *3-Mode Layer Toggle:* Restructured the Layer dropdown selector in both Daily and Weekly activity cards into 3 intuitive modes: ① `Layer: Time` (时长的柱状图), ② `Layer: Distractions` (分心的折线图), ③ `Layer: Both` (两者都有), with persistent local storage.
  - *Deep Red for Unavoidable Interruptions:* Changed the color representation for "Unavoidable" interruptions from rose-pink (`#fb7185`) to a distinct, high-contrast deep crimson red (`#ef4444` / `text-red-400` / `bg-red-500/20`), clearly separating it from Afternoon's orange (`#f97316` / `#fb923c`) across the Timer buttons, Chart trend lines, and Popover tooltips.

- **v9.0.18 (2026-08-28):** Fix Recharts Line Right-Side Animation Clipping Bug
  - *ClipPath Animation Bug Fix:* Disabled `isAnimationActive` on `ComposedChart` `Line` and `Bar` series in both Daily and Weekly charts. This eliminates Recharts' dynamic SVG clipPath truncation where line segments were prematurely cut off midway before connecting to rightmost data points.
  - *Balanced Margins:* Normalized chart margins to symmetric `margin={{ top: 12, right: 16, left: 16, bottom: 0 }}` ensuring consistent padding and unobstructed rendering for all nodes and line paths across all screen sizes.

- **v9.0.17 (2026-08-28):** Streamlined Layer Dropdown & Matching Timer Distraction Colors with Light Strokes
  - *Streamlined Layer Dropdown:* Replaced multi-button layer toggle groups in Daily & Weekly headers with compact, elegant dropdown selectors matching the "Last 7d / Natural" pill design (`Layer: All`, `Layer: Internal`, `Layer: External`, `Layer: Unavoidable`, `Layer: Off`).
  - *Timer-Matched Distraction Colors:* Aligned the 3 distraction trend lines and tooltip badges directly with the Timer interface's color scheme (Internal: Indigo `#818cf8`, External: Orange `#fb923c`, Unavoidable: Rose `#fb7185`).
  - *Light-Colored Dot Strokes:* Replaced dark dot borders with clean, high-contrast light white strokes (`stroke: '#ffffff'`) on chart dots and active hover states for superior visibility across all dark and light themes.

- **v9.0.16 (2026-08-27):** Refined Distraction Layer Controls, Chart Margin & SVG Icon Purity
  - *SVG Icon Purity:* Replaced all emojis in `SharedPopoverContent` and `CustomDailyTooltip` with pure Lucide SVG icons (`Brain`, `Wind`, `Zap`), strictly eliminating emoji usage across tooltips and popovers.
  - *High-Contrast Chart Lines:* Shifted Distraction trend lines to non-colliding colors (Internal: Sky `#38bdf8`, External: Emerald `#34d399`, Unavoidable: Rose `#f43f5e`) ensuring crisp contrast against Yellow, Orange, Indigo, and Slate bars.
  - *Right Boundary Margin Fix:* Added `margin={{ top: 12, right: 18, left: -20, bottom: 0 }}` and `overflow: 'visible'` to `ComposedChart` in both Daily and Weekly views to prevent rightmost dots and line endpoints from being clipped.
  - *Header Row Layer Controls:* Relocated Distraction Layer toggle buttons directly into the header rows of both Daily and Weekly activity cards, creating a cleaner and unified card layout.

- **v9.0.15 (2026-08-27):** Dual-Layer Distraction Composed Charts & Hourly Interruption Rate KPIs
  - *Composed Dual-Layer Charts:* Upgraded Daily and Weekly activity charts from simple BarCharts to Recharts `ComposedChart` with dual Y-axes (`yAxisId="left"` for session durations, `yAxisId="right"` for distraction counts), preventing scale interference between minutes and counts.
  - *Distraction Trend Lines & Filters:* Added individual trend lines for Internal (`#818cf8`), External (`#fb923c`), and Unavoidable (`#fb7185`) interruptions, along with top layer filter toggles (`All`, `Internal`, `External`, `Unavoidable`, `Hide`) and local persistence.
  - *Hourly Distraction Rate KPI (次/h):* Refactored the Daily "Distracted" and Weekly "Avg Distracted" KPI cards to calculate the normalized focus interruption rate `(分心次数 / 专注时长小时数) 次/h` to accurately reflect focus quality.
  - *Interactive Tooltips:* Enhanced Daily and Weekly chart tooltips with rich popovers breaking down total distraction counts, hourly rates, and per-type distributions with themed icons.

- **v9.0.14 (2026-08-27):** Daily Activity Section & Chart Dependency Robustness Fix
  - *Data & Computation Integrity:* Fixed date validation in `getPeriodInfo` and memoized session and reward fetchers (`getSessionsForDate`, `getRewardsForDate`) to ensure the Daily section updates smoothly on date changes.
  - *Distraction & NaN Safeguards:* Added universal fallback calculations for `distractions` in `dailyGains`, `weeklyGains`, `dailyData`, and `heatmapSummary` to prevent `NaN` values from breaking the Daily gains cards and charts.
  - *Daily Pie Chart Dependencies:* Resolved undeclared dependency bugs in `DailyPieChart.tsx` by directly watching `sessions`, `date`, `dungeons`, and `timeSettings`.

- **v9.0.12 (2026-08-27):** Restored Subtle Inline Translucent Badges with Fixed Footprints
  - *UI Aesthetic Restoration:* Reverted the 100% opaque corner badge back to the elegant, subtle theme-aware translucent inline pill badges (`bg-indigo-500/20 text-indigo-400`, `bg-orange-500/20 text-orange-400`, `bg-rose-500/20 text-rose-400`).
  - *Zero-Jitter Fixed Layout:* Maintained fixed, tailored button widths (`w-[84px] sm:w-[94px] md:w-[104px]` for Internal/External, `w-[96px] sm:w-[106px] md:w-[118px]` for Unavoidable) so that buttons never expand, shrink, or push neighboring elements when counts change.

- **v9.0.11 (2026-08-27):** Fixed Distraction Footprint & Zero-Jitter Badges
  - *Layout Stability:* Standardized all three Distraction buttons (Internal, External, Unavoidable) with fixed proportional width dimensions (`w-[86px] sm:w-[98px] md:w-[112px]`).
  - *Zero Layout Shift:* Converted distraction counts from inline flow elements to non-intrusive bottom-right absolute corner badges (`absolute -bottom-1 -right-0.5`). Clicking distraction buttons and recording counts now preserves the exact same container footprint without any stretching, shifting, or jumping.

- **v9.0.10 (2026-08-27):** Persistent Distraction Controls & Layout Stability
  - *UI & UX Stability:* Distraction tracking controls (Internal, External, Unavoidable) are now permanently and stably visible during all focus timer states (ready to start, running, paused) rather than appearing only after clicking start. This eliminates layout shifts and abrupt pop-ins upon starting a focus session.
  - *Compact / PIP Parity:* Ensured consistent visibility and standardized notification badge positioning in both full timer and Compact (Picture-in-Picture) timer views.

- **v9.0.9 (2026-08-27):** Dynamic Mathematical Layout & Absolute Non-Overlapping Guarantee
  - *Layout Architecture:* Replaced manual / absolute positioning with an integrated Flex column layout where Distractions, Controls, and the Circular Arena are distinct sequential flex children (`justify-between`), completely eliminating any possibility of Controls overlapping Distractions.
  - *Mathematical Safe Sizing:* Implemented a dynamic calculation hook using `ResizeObserver` that measures exact container height/width in real-time, deducts the precise heights of Controls, Distraction controls, and safety margins, and computes `safeDiameter`. Circle scaling (0.85 -> 1.0) strictly respects this ceiling so it will never overlap or push into adjacent components regardless of screen height or distraction count.

- **v9.0.8 (2026-08-27):** Fullscreen Distraction Bottom Anchor & Expanded Circular Arena
  - *UI Refactor:* Re-anchored the active Distraction tracker to the absolute bottom of the screen (`absolute bottom-4 sm:bottom-6 left-1/2 -translate-x-1/2`) when in Fullscreen mode.
  - *Layout & Sizing:* Freed up vertical space for the central timer display by separating distractions from the controls flex flow, expanding the maximum responsive bounds of the timer in fullscreen mode up to `max-w-[540px]` / `max-h-[540px]` on wide viewports without any danger of overlapping.

- **v9.0.7 (2026-08-27):** Distraction Scale Dynamic Curve & Fullscreen Zero-Overlap Layout
  - *UI Adjustment:* Refined the focus timer circle's starting scale to 0.85 (more compact and elegant) and smoothly scales up to maximum 1.0 upon reaching 10 distractions (`0.85 + (min(distractions, 10) / 10) * 0.15`).
  - *Layout:* Restructured the Fullscreen Explore layout into a strict flexbox column where the top dungeon progress bar is part of the layout flow (`shrink-0`) and the timer gets the exact remaining viewport space (`flex-1 min-h-0`), guaranteeing that even at maximum scale and distraction count, the circle will never overlap the progress bar or bottom distraction controls.

- **v9.0.6 (2026-08-27):** Distractions in PIP, Custom Sounds & Fullscreen Layout Fix
  - *Feature:* Added the Distraction tracking module to the Compact (Picture-in-Picture) timer interface, migrating the state up to `useTimerStore`.
  - *Audio:* Implemented new synthesized audio feedback effects (`pop` and `error` in Web Audio API) so that the three distraction buttons now emit distinct sounds (Click, Pop, Error) for immediate blind-feedback.
  - *Bugfix:* Removed arbitrary CSS transform scales (`lg:scale-[1.35]`) from the Fullscreen Explore layout which was causing the dynamically expanding Timer component (under distraction pressure) to overflow flexbox constraints and visually overlap the top progress bar and bottom distractions panel. Reduced maximum distraction pressure scale to 5% to maintain visual integrity.

- **v9.0.5 (2026-08-13):** Distraction Tracking Feature
  - *Feature:* Added three localized distraction tracking buttons (自身 Internal, 环境 External, 不可抗 Unavoidable) right below the active timer controls to allow users to manually log interruptions during focus sessions.
  - *UI Adjustment:* Updated the Recent Sessions history table to dynamically compute and display a "Focus Quality" (专注度) score for sessions that recorded distractions, highlighting the precise count of each interruption type.

- **v9.0.4 (2026-06-23):** Force Check-in Fix & UI Slider Styling
  - *Bugfix:* Bypassed completeSession logic during manual Routine Tracker check-ins to directly append the session into local history. This guarantees a forced check-in completes accurately regardless of dungeon progression states, whilst omitting game rewards to prevent cheating. Popover now correctly closes after submission to offer immediate UI feedback.
  - *UI Adjustment:* Extracted HTML Range slider styles across the application settings panel. Thrice thickened the track visually (8px height) and integrated dynamic CSS linear-gradients to distinctly differentiate the covered (slid) and uncovered (unslid) regions for both WebKit & Firefox natively based on element value percentages.

- **v9.0.3 (2026-06-23):** Scrollbar OS Overrides & Check-in UTC Bug
  - *Bugfix:* Patched WebKit scrollbars ignoring customizations on Chrome 121+ by disabling the generic CSS `scrollbar-color` specification on non-Firefox browsers. The scrollbars will now properly retain theme `border-radius` and `background-clip` padding.
  - *Bugfix:* Forced `RoutineCellEditor` to synthesize timestamps via explicit physical `Date.UTC` mappings instead of looping an OS localizer. Fixes checks silently failing to commit on select time zones due to off-by-one mismatches.

- **v9.0.2 (2026-06-23):** Scrollbar & Routine Check-in Fix
  - *Bugfix:* Re-wrote routine manual check-in target timestamp synthesis to guarantee that the converted physical timezone mapped exactly to the user's selected grid-box timeframe.
  - *Bugfix:* Extracted custom scrollbar global CSS mapping (`.custom-scrollbar::-webkit-scrollbar`) out of Tailwind's internal `@layer base` sandbox into the global cascade layer. This patches an issue where browser native UI was preempting the style on WebKit rendering engines.

- **v9.0.1 (2026-06-23):** Heatmap Grid Quick-Add Timezone Fix
  - *Bugfix:* Fixed a critical timezone parsing bug in the Routine Tracker quick-add interface where `customTimestamp` was incorrectly converted into an ISO string via an intermediate local-time `Date` formatter, causing manual additions to silently drift backwards by a day. Manual inputs now enforce strict absolute UTC stamps.

- **v9.0.0 (2026-06-23):** Official Major Update
  - *Loot Pool Config:* Added Fixed/Free Loot Pool modes. Fixed Mode restricts edits to maintain a default 100-point balanced experience across 6 rarities while allowing customizations to text descriptions. Free mode preserves previous setups.
  - *Performance:* Decoupled the timer state using Zustand. It significantly boosts performance by preventing massive VDOM re-renders during countdowns.
  - *Notes & Reflections:* Users can now log study notes directly at the end of sessions. Added features to edit previous notes, hashtag filters, and automatic integration into daily reflections.
  - *Routine Tracker:* Revamped Routine Tracker to allow adding stats, inline duration editing, and hiding tasks. Includes a detailed full-screen stats view with date ranges.
  - *Fellowship Tools:* Captains can now Reclaim captaincy if they leave and rejoin. Captains can also directly Banish (Kick) inactive members, syncing stats immediately.
  - *UI & Polish:* Re-enabled theme-aware custom scrollbars. Added Merchant Outpost shortcut, adjusted Alchemy scaling multiplier (+15%), and re-scaled Grandmaster rank boundary.
