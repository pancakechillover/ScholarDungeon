# Project Tracker & Agent Instructions

## Role & Workflow
You are an AI assistant maintaining the "Scholar's Dungeon" project. 
At the start of every interaction, you automatically read this file (injected into your system prompt).

**ACTIVE DEVELOPMENT DIRECTIVE:**
- Currently developing features step-by-step strictly according to the multi-phase implementation roadmap in `Plan.md` (Workstation Presence & Target Focus Time Upgrade).

**CRITICAL RULE FOR EVERY UPDATE:**
We now separate updates into **Preview Updates** (预览更新) and **Official Updates** (正式更新):

**1. Preview Updates (预览更新 - Default):**
- Update the `APP_VERSION` in `src/version.ts`.
- Update the `Current Version` and `Last Update Date` in this `AGENTS.md` file.
- Log the completed task in the `Task History` section below.
- *Do not* modify `RELEASE_HISTORY` in `src/version.ts` or `public/version.json`.

**2. Official Updates (正式更新 - Only when requested):**
- Do all the steps for Preview Updates.
- Aggregate all features/fixes logged in `AGENTS.md` since the last Official Update.
- Write a comprehensive changelog summarizing these updates.
- Update `RELEASE_HISTORY` in `src/version.ts` with this aggregated changelog.
- Update `public/version.json` with the new version and changelog to trigger the app update popup.

**VERSIONING POLICY (x.y.z):**
- **x (Major):** Critical architectural changes or full-scale system overhauls.
- **y (Minor):** New features, significant UI additions, or functional enhancements.
- **z (Patch):** Bug fixes, micro-optimizations, documentation updates, and UI refinements.

**COMMUNICATION RULE:**
- You MUST ALWAYS reply to the user in Chinese (Simplified). This is an absolute requirement for every response you give.

**CSS & UI STANDARDS:**
- **Strict English UI Standard:** All UI elements across the application (labels, titles, headings, buttons, badges, tabs, tooltips, placeholders, modal dialogs, and settings descriptions) MUST strictly and exclusively be in English. NEVER use Chinese characters or bilingual slash labels (such as `English / 中文`) in the application interface or code. (Note: The assistant still replies to the user in Chinese (Simplified) during chat interactions, but the app UI itself is 100% pure English).
- **Full-Screen Modals:** Whenever creating a "full-screen" centered modal (especially `fixed inset-0`), you MUST use `createPortal(..., document.body)` from `react-dom` to render the modal directly on the `body`. If you do not use `createPortal`, parent elements with CSS `transform`, `filter`, or `perspective` will establish unintended containing blocks that capture the `fixed` positioning, causing the modal to appear in the middle of a scrolling page container instead of the actual screen view. Never make this mistake again.
- **Italic Clipping:** To prevent right-side clipping of italic text (especially in browsers with tight bounding boxes), always add a small right padding (e.g., `pr-1` or `px-0.5`) to the element or its immediate container.
- **Red Dot / Notification Placement:** Unread message or notification badges (red dots) on icons and buttons MUST ALWAYS be placed in the bottom-right corner (e.g. `absolute -bottom-0.5 -right-0.5`), NEVER in the top-right corner.
- **Touch-Friendly Controls:** Delete buttons or other critical actions MUST NOT be hover-only (e.g. `opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100`), as this is unfriendly to touch-screen users. They should be visible or adapt properly for mobile devices.
- **Theme-Aware Colors & Minimalist UI:** We have 6 different theme colors. Every color choice (especially backgrounds, progress bars, or buttons) MUST consider all themes to maintain a minimalist and premium aesthetic. Avoid thick, flashy, or hardcoded colors like `bg-emerald-500` which may look jarring or "rough" (粗率) in certain themes. Rely on theme-aware colors (`indigo-300`, `indigo-400`, `indigo-500`, `indigo-600`) or neutral slate colors with opacity. DO NOT use `indigo-200` or `indigo-700`+ for primary themed elements, as they will appear in the default blue color across all themes.

## Current Status
- **Current Version:** v9.2.9
- **Last Update Date:** 2026-09-07
- **Last Update Time:** 06:35:00

## Dark Themes Definition
The following themes are considered "Dark Themes" and form the baseline for vibrant visual effects and high-contrast glowing elements:
- **Night** (`data-theme="night"`)
- **Forest** (`data-theme="forest"`)
- **Ocean** (`data-theme="ocean"`)

## Light Themes Definition
The following themes are considered "Light Themes" and require special CSS handling (e.g., avoiding white text on light backgrounds, using theme-aware colors for modals and charts):
- **Daylight** (`data-theme="daylight"`)
- **Warm Sun** (`state.theme === "warm"`)
- **Candy** (`state.theme === "candy"`)

## Push Notification Troubleshooting Protocols
Due to inconsistencies in Web Push delivery in various environments (Iframes, PWAs), follow this hierarchy:
1. **Execution Context:** Web Push is often blocked in cross-origin IFRAMES. Always test by opening the app in a **New Tab** or as an **Installed PWA**.
2. **Direct Permission Check:** Verify address bar shows "Allowed". 
3. **Service Worker Console:** Switch to `Application -> Service Workers -> Inspect` in DevTools to see SW-specific logs (`[Service Worker]`). Main console may skip these.
4. **OS Level:** Check Windows Focus Assist or macOS Do Not Disturb.
5. **Direct API Test:** Use the "Test Local Notification (Direct)" tool in Developer settings. If this fails, the browser/OS is blocking notifications globally.
6. **VAPID Integrity:** If VAPID keys change, "Clear Server Sub" + "Reset Service Worker" is mandatory.


## Task History
> Detailed task history is archived and maintained in `TaskHistory.md` (retaining at most the 3 most recent entries).

- **v9.2.9 (2026-09-07):** Weekly Distraction Hourly Rate Metric & Efficiency Trend Interaction Fix
  - *Distraction Rate Metric (/h):* Updated the distraction line charts in the Weekly view (`StatsWeeklySection.tsx` & `Stats.tsx`) to measure distraction intensity by hourly rate (`distractions / (focusHours)` as `count/h`) rather than raw counts; updated Y-axis tick formatting to `${val}/h` with flexible decimal support and appropriate right padding.
  - *Efficiency Trend Bubble Interaction:* Fixed unclickable bubble points on the Weekly Efficiency Trend chart by decoupling the LineChart key from the ComposedChart key with `lineChartKey`, stabilizing tooltips against unmount cycles, and mapping direct data property keys for precise Recharts hit detection.

- **v9.2.8 (2026-09-07):** Modernized Edit Session Architecture & Full-Featured Bulk Session Operations Hub
  - *Unified Edit Session Modal:* Transferred Study Note authoring/editing directly into the dedicated `EditSessionModal` with live hashtag insertion pills; added editable distraction breakdown counters (`Internal`, `External`, `Unavoidable`); eliminated manual Total Duration input by auto-calculating `Total = Focus + Rest`.
  - *Full-Featured Bulk Session Operations Hub:* Completely modernized `BulkSessionModal.tsx` into a 3-tab hub:
    - `Batch Actions`: Interactive session search and dungeon/time filters, multi-select toolbar, batch dungeon re-assignment, bulk tag append, batch timestamp shift (+/- hours), distraction reset, batch deletion, and JSON data export.
    - `Generator`: Presets (Pomodoro, Deep Work, Ultradian, Custom), date/time boundaries, auto or fixed session counts, and live timeline preview.
    - `Range Purge`: Visual date/time range purge with matching session counter and destructive confirmation.
  - *Cleaned Recent Sessions Table:* Replaced cluttered inline accordion rows with direct modal triggers and added elegant note previews in the objective column.

- **v9.2.7 (2026-09-07):** Recent Sessions Elimination of Scrollbar Flash on Row Deletion
  - *Table Row Exit Animation Optimization:* Removed disruptive `mode="popLayout"` from `<AnimatePresence>` in `RecentSessions.tsx` and switched to `layout="position"` with a fast, smooth fade-out (`duration: 0.15s`), preventing deleted `<tr>` elements from turning into absolute-positioned out-of-flow blocks that momentarily expand container height.
  - *Confirm Modal Non-Intrusive Scroll State:* Removed `document.body.style.overflow = 'hidden'` toggling from `ConfirmModal.tsx`, keeping page body overflow completely stable during dialog confirmation without triggering scrollbar show/hide layout shifts.
  - *Cross-Browser Scrollbar Rule Hardening:* Added standard `scrollbar-width: none` and `-ms-overflow-style: none` to `html, body, #root` in `src/index.css` to prevent brief browser-native scrollbar flashes on modern browsers.
